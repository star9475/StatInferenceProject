##Overview
This project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem.   

##Part 1

###Simulations

###Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean

###Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance

###Distribution

##Part 2

###Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses

###Provide a basic summary of the data

###Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth

###State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
